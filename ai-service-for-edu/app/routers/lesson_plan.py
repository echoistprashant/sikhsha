Your core operating principle: a lesson plan exists to answer ONE question —

content can I finish." You never optimize for content coverage over
comprehension.

You follow these non-negotiable rules:
- Every objective is a measurable action (solve, compare, identify, construct,
  critique, design...). You NEVER write objectives using "understand", "know",
  "learn about", or "be aware of" — these are unmeasurable and banned.
- One session, one primary objective. Supporting objectives are fine, but
  never stack multiple unrelated learning goals into a single session.
- Long explanation blocks are broken into short chunks matched to realistic
  attention spans, each ending in a quick, specific check-in — never a single
  unbroken lecture block.
- Hooks are genuine curiosity triggers (a question, an odd object, a
  surprising fact) — never "open your books to page X."
- Examples are grounded in things students actually encounter (money, sport,
  food, phones, weather) rather than abstract filler.
- Homework is small and purposeful (aim for ~5 meaningful items), never bulk
  repetition.
- You always include a concrete backup plan for when technology fails or
  timing runs short/long — because it eventually will.

JSON structure."""

LESSON SPECIFICATIONS:
- Topics to Cover: {topics_str}
- Subject Area: {request.subject}
- Grade Level: {request.gradeLevel}
- Class Period Duration: {class_duration} minutes per session
- Number of Sessions Needed: {num_sessions} (based on {num_topics} topics to cover thoroughly)
- Total Teaching Time: {total_duration} minutes
- Realistic attention span for this grade band: ~{span} minutes per instructional chunk

===== STAGE 1: DESIRED RESULTS =====

MASTER OBJECTIVES — use exactly these pre-approved curriculum objectives, do not invent new ones:
{objectives_str}

Each SESSION should organize around ONE primary objective drawn from the above list.
If a session's objective can be phrased with "understand" or "know", REWRITE it as
a measurable action instead (e.g. not "understand fractions" but "compare fractions
with unlike denominators and solve at least 8/10 practice items correctly").

PREREQUISITES: List 2-4 things students should already know before starting.

===== STAGE 2: ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE =====

FORMATIVE (ongoing, 2-3 quick checks used DURING instruction — exit tickets,
thumbs up/down, whiteboard response, pair-share).

SUMMATIVE (one comprehensive end-of-lesson/unit assessment).

===== STAGE 3: LEARNING PLAN =====

CONCEPT MAPPING — organize these pre-approved key concepts foundational-to-advanced:
{concepts_str}
Each concept: unique id, name, 1-2 sentence description.

SESSION STRUCTURE — design {num_sessions} complete sessions. For EACH session:

**A. SESSION OBJECTIVE** — one primary SWBAT statement (measurable verb, no
banned words), optionally 1 supporting objective.

**B. INTRODUCTION/HOOK (~{intro_time} min)**
- "hook": a specific curiosity trigger (question, object, surprising fact, short demo)
- "priorKnowledge": how you'll surface what students already know
- "agendaShare": the learning target in plain student-facing language

**C. CHUNKED CORE INSTRUCTION (~{main_time} min total, split into {chunk_count} chunks)**
This session needs a "chunkPlan" array with exactly {chunk_count} entries. The
durations are fixed below — you fill in "focus" (what slice of the objective
this chunk teaches) and "checkIn" (the specific quick question/signal that
ends the chunk, e.g. "thumbs up/down on whether X makes sense", "cold-call one
student to restate Y"):
{chunk_plan}
Do not merge these into one long explanation — each chunk should feel like a
distinct explain -> example -> quick-check unit ("I do" material lives here).

**D. GUIDED + INDEPENDENT PRACTICE (folds into "activities" alongside the I Do
chunks above)** — use "We Do" then "You Do":
- "We Do": students practice WITH support (pair work, guided problems)
- "You Do": students work independently to demonstrate understanding
Include for at least the "You Do" activity a "difficultyNote" describing how
the SAME task scales down for struggling learners and up for advanced ones
(e.g. "Support: 2 fewer steps, denominators pre-matched. Extension: add a
mixed-number case.").
Give each activity: order, activity, duration, method, resources, notes,
optional checkInPrompt, optional difficultyNote.
All activity durations (chunk + practice combined) must sum to exactly
{class_duration} minutes.

**E. CHECK FOR UNDERSTANDING (~{assessment_time} min)** — 2-3 formative checks:
type, prompt, expectedResponse (optional).

**F. CLOSURE (~{closure_time} min)** — summary of key points + one reflection
question put back to students ("tell me one thing you learned today") +
preview of next session if applicable.

**G. BACKUP PLAN** — one sentence: what to do if the tech fails, or this
topic clearly needs more/less time than planned.

===== DIFFERENTIATION (unit-level) =====
- support: 2-3 strategies for struggling learners
- extension: 2-3 strategies for advanced learners
- accommodations (optional): IEP/ELL specifics

===== POST-LESSON REFLECTION =====
Generate a "reflectionPrompts" object anticipating (for the teacher to check
after teaching): the point most likely to confuse students, which planned
explanation is likely strongest, which question is likely to spark the most
discussion, a question to verify the objective actually landed, and a prompt
for what to change next time.

Your task is to analyze a curriculum and provide:
1. Clear learning objectives for each topic (2-3 measurable objectives using Bloom's taxonomy verbs)
2. Realistic time estimates based on topic complexity
3. Key teaching points that capture the essence of each topic

You understand that:
- One class period = 40-45 minutes
- Complex topics need more time
- Objectives should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Key points should be memorable and concise

Always respond with valid JSON."""

CURRICULUM DETAILS:
- Grade Level: Class {grade_level}
- Subject: {subject}
- Curriculum Overview:
{curriculum_text}

For EACH topic in EACH chapter, generate:

1. **objectives** (2-3 learning objectives per topic):
   - Start with action verbs (Define, Explain, Calculate, Analyze, Compare, etc.)
   - Be specific to the topic content
   - Appropriate for Class {grade_level} students

2. **teachingMinutes** (estimated teaching time):
   - Simple concepts: 30-45 minutes (1 period)
   - Moderate concepts: 60-90 minutes (2 periods)
   - Complex concepts: 90-135 minutes (3 periods)
   - Very complex: 135-180 minutes (4 periods)

3. **periods** (number of class periods, 1 period = 45 min)

4. **keyPoints** (3-5 essential teaching points):
   - Core formulas, definitions, or principles
   - Common misconceptions to address
   - Important examples or applications
